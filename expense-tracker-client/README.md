## Welcome to Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a tool created using Ruby-on-Rails for the back-end and ReactJS/JavaScript
for the front-end.

It is meant to demonstrate the quickness of React's updating of state and JavasScript's asynchronous
web requests.

The app idea was conceived in an attempt to help people who haven't made the full transition to online banking yet and prefer to do their banking using check-ledgers. It is an electronic check-ledger book with full CRUD capabilities as demonstrated in the gif.
